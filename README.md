### GlobalLogic Linux Kernel BaseCamp Project
The main goal of this project is to practice writing Linux kernel modules by creating a simple device and writing its drivers.

# Simple Inclinometer


An inclinometer is a device used to measure the angle of slope or inclination of an object with respect to the horizontal plane. It is also known as a tilt sensor, clinometer or slope meter. Inclinometers can be used in a wide range of applications, from measuring the pitch and roll of aircraft and ships to monitoring the angle of a drilling rig or the tilt of a building or bridge.

This project combines two devices. An OLED matrix with SSD1306 display controller to display data from MPU6050 sensor module in real-time.

The MPU6050 is a 6-axis gyroscope and accelerometer sensor module. It can measure both linear acceleration and angular velocity in three dimensions, providing accurate motion tracking data.

The SSD1306 is a single-chip CMOS OLED/PLED driver with controller for organic/polymer light emitting diode dot-matrix graphic display system. It consists of 128 segments and 64 commons.
